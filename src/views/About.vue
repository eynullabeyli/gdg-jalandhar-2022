            Google Developer Group Jalandhar is inspired by GTUG/GDG Family . We
            started our journey in Feb 2011. We try to engage student
            developers, fresh graduates and professionals through our hack
            events & meetups. The motive is to create a local ecosystem of
            programmers & hackers in and around Jalandhar. The technology
            awareness is main goal for first few years of the group.
            <br /><br />
            To put it in a nutshell, we are a community that organizes tech
            talks, workshops, bootcamps, Google flagship events where
            programmers meet to discuss and work with several Google developer
            resources and products.
